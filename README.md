# ReflectSix

Screen-space reflections for Single Player Tarkov. ReflectSix replaces Tarkov's built-in SSR with its own
reflections on water, puddles, glass and wet ground. They stay stable in motion and are correct in VR, where
the game's own SSR doesn't work at all. Works on flatscreen and in VR.

## Features

- Smooth reflections on rough surfaces
- Water flows down walls when it's raining
- Compatible with CloudSix, base game SSR does not reflect my clouds
- Compatible with SPT-VR

## Requirements

- SPT 4.1.

## Install

1. Extract the release into your SPT folder. You should end up with:
   ```
   BepInEx/plugins/ReflectSix/ReflectSix.dll
   BepInEx/plugins/ReflectSix/Assets/reflectsix
   ```
2. In Tarkov's graphics settings, turn **SSR on**. ReflectSix stops the game's SSR from rendering, but the setting
   puts the game's materials in the state ReflectSix's reflections expect. With it off, wet surfaces can show
   blinding baked reflections, especially at night.
3. Launch the game.

## Settings

Open the in-game configuration manager (F12) or edit `BepInEx/config/com.matsix.reflectsix.cfg`.
These are the main ones. The Advanced view has many more.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Enabled | On | Turns ReflectSix's reflections on or off. |
| Disable Tarkov SSR Render | On | Stops the game's own SSR from drawing, so the two never stack. |
| Intensity | 1 | Reflection strength. 1 is physically based. |
| Smoothness Cutoff | 0.55 | Only surfaces at least this smooth reflect. Lower it for more wet-looking surfaces, at more cost. |
| Reflection Softness | 0 | Extra blur on every reflection. 0 is razor sharp. |
| Foliage Gloss Reduction | 0.9 | Keeps grass from looking glossy. |
| Rain Streaks On Walls | 0.4 | Strength of the rain running down walls. |
| Temporal Smoothing | 0.8 | Denoises the reflections, at the cost of some smudging in motion. |
| Ray Steps | 160 | How far a ray can travel across the screen. |
| Max Distance | 160 | How far a reflected ray may travel, in metres. |

The Advanced view also has glossy and stochastic options, trace tuning, a half-resolution trace and debug views.

## Performance

If you need frames back:

- Keep **Half-Resolution Trace** on (Advanced view, on by default). It's the biggest win for a small quality cost.
- Lower **Ray Steps**. This also tends to make reflections steadier.
- Raise **Smoothness Cutoff** so fewer surfaces are traced.

## Compatibility

- **CloudSix (optional, recommended):** turn on CloudSix's **Publish Sky For Reflections** and ReflectSix reflects the live sky and clouds in every direction, with no seam. A roof check keeps clouds out of indoor reflections. Without CloudSix, sky that isn't on screen falls back to the game's baked reflection probes.
- **FogSix:** reflections are drawn before the fog, so they get fogged like the rest of the scene. The path from the surface to what it reflects is fogged too. ReflectSix works the same with or without FogSix.
- **SPT-VR:** supported.

## Known limitations

- Reflections are drawn before transparent objects, so they appear under glass and smoke rather than on top.
- Reflections in a magnified scope (Reflections In Scopes, on by default) cost about as much again while you aim through it.

## Building from source

```sh
dotnet build ReflectSix.csproj -c Release
```

The project references the game's DLLs from a local `libs/` folder that isn't in the repository. Copy these
into it from your SPT install:

- From `EscapeFromTarkov_Data/Managed`: `Assembly-CSharp.dll`, `Comfort.dll`, `Comfort.Unity.dll`, `UnityEngine.dll`, `UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll`, `UnityEngine.PhysicsModule.dll`, `UnityEngine.AssetBundleModule.dll`, `Unity.Postprocessing.Runtime.dll`
- From `BepInEx/core`: `0Harmony.dll`, `BepInEx.dll`
- From `BepInEx/plugins/spt`: `spt-reflection.dll`

The reflection shader ships compiled in the `reflectsix` bundle in each release. Its source isn't part of this
repository.
